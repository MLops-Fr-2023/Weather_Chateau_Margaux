        This site is dedicated to an innovative project that aims to predict the weather in the M√©doc (France, Gironde), a week in advance. 
        Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, our approach leverages transformer models applied to time series data, paving a new way 
        for weather prediction technologies.
        
        M√©doc, renowned for its prestigious vineyards and rich wine culture, poses unique challenges for its vintners due to its variable weather patterns. 
        Weather plays an essential role in viticulture, from vine growth to grape maturity, and ultimately, the quality of the wine produced. 
        Therefore, reliable weather forecasting is of paramount importance to the vintners in M√©doc.

        For vineyard managers, precise weather prediction helps inform daily decision-making, from adjusting watering schedules to choosing the optimal time for harvesting. 
        Predicting weather patterns accurately can also provide early warnings about potential hazards like frost or drought, enabling preventive measures that can save an 
        entire year's crop.

        Our project aims to enhance the precision of these weather predictions, improving the tools at the vintners' disposal to manage their vineyards more effectively. 
        By harnessing the power of transformer models and machine learning, we aim to provide a forecast that can help secure the future of M√©doc's wine industry and contribute 
        to its ongoing success.

        In this repository, you will find the codes, data, and models used for this project. Your contributions, suggestions, and insights are warmly welcomed.
        We hope that our efforts will assist the vintners of M√©doc in their noble pursuit of creating the world's finest wines. Join us on this journey of innovation, precision, and a shared passion for viticulture.
